smss.exe
Normal?
Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\smss.exe
Parent Process:  System
Number of Instances:  One master instance and child instance per session. The child instance exits after creating the session.
User Account:  Local System
Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time for the master instance

What is unusual?
A different parent process other than System(4)
Image path is different from C:\Windows\System32
More than 1 running process. (children self-terminate and exit after each new session)
User is not SYSTEM
Unexpected registry entries for Subsystem

csrss.exe
Normal?
Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\csrss.exe
Parent Process:  Created by an instance of smss.exe
Number of Instances:  Two or more
User Account:  Local System
Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time for the first 2 instances (for Session 0 and 1).  Start times for additional instances occur as new sessions are created, although often only Sessions 0 and 1 are created.

What is unusual?
An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process masquerading as csrss.exe in plain sight
User is not SYSTEM

wininit.exe
Normal?
Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\wininit.exe
Parent Process:  Created by an instance of smss.exe
Number of Instances:  One
User Account:  Local System
Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time

What is unusual?
An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)

Multiple running instances
Not running as SYSTEM

services.exe
Information regarding services is stored in the registry, HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services. 
This process also loads device drivers marked as auto-start into memory. 
When a user logs into a machine successfully, this process is responsible for setting the value of the Last Known Good control set (Last Known Good Configuration), HKLM\System\Select\LastKnownGood, to that of the CurrentControlSet. 
This process is the parent to several other key processes: svchost.exe, spoolsv.exe, msmpeng.exe, dllhost.exe...

Normal?
Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\services.exe
Parent Process:  wininit.exe
Number of Instances:  One
User Account:  Local System
Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time

What is unusual?
A parent process other than wininit.exe
Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
Multiple running instances

svchost.exe
The services running in this process are implemented as DLLs. The DLL to implement is stored in the registry for the service under the Parameters subkey in ServiceDLL.
The full path is HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SERVICE NAME\Parameters.
Normal?
Image Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe
Parent Process: services.exe
Number of Instances: Many
User Account: Varies (SYSTEM, Network Service, Local Service) depending on the svchost.exe instance. In Windows 10 some instances can run as the logged-in user.
Start Time: Typically within seconds of boot time. Other instances can be started after boot

What is unusual?
A parent process other than services.exe
Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32

The absence of the -k parameter

lsass.exe
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
creates security tokens for SAM (Security Account Manager), AD (Active Directory), and NETLOGON
Common tools such as mimikatz is used to dump credentials or they mimic this process to hide in plain sight.
Again, they do this by either naming their malware by this process name or simply misspelling the malware slightly. 
Normal?
Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\lsass.exe
Parent Process:  wininit.exe
Number of Instances:  One
User Account:  Local System

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winlogon
Normal?

Parent Process:  Created by an instance of smss.exe that exits, so analysis tools usually do not provide the parent process name.
Number of Instances:  One or more
User Account:  Local System
Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time for the first instance (for Session 1).  Additional instances occur as new sessions are created, typically through Remote Desktop or Fast User Switching logons.
