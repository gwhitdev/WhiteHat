ACTIVITY 1.1
3 Threats
	1. Information about members may be accessed by those unauthorised to do so.
	2. Conservation information may be used by those who do nit agree with the conservation goal, or who vested interests in the opposite.
	3. Installation of malicious code or software on the website server may compromise the website and cause unofficial messages to be displayed.

3 Vulnerabilities
	1. Records held in various unreliable ways. 
	2. Inadequate security awarness allowing old technologies to continue with no or little monitoring and maintenance.
	3. A lack of systems for identification, authentication, authorisation on the network and application layers.

3 Risks
	1. The risk of data being stolen is high.
	2. The risk of information systems being penetrated by someone with malicious, or even curious, intent is high.
	3. The risk of people having access to information that they should not have is high.
	
ACTIVITY 1.2
1. What would the impact be on partner organisations' perception of GANT if future attacks were successful? Would they remove their support?
2. What would the impact be on members if their data was destroyed or leaked? What would the cost(s) be to GANT if they have to pay compensation etc?
3. The costs of reintroducing toads if they were 'removed' from particular land could be detrimental to the organisation and future conservation efforts if information that is held in the charity's records were to be accessed by unauthorised users or otherwise shared without authorisation.
